# Footmen-vs-Grunts-Reloaded
This is a derived version of the Warcraft 3 custom game named `Footmen vs Grunts` made & udpated by `Compit` since 2010
`Footmen vs Grunts` is a custom game where units automatically spawn and are controlled by the player, game can handle more than 500+ units on screen.
The player can control all its unit at the same time using abilities that issue orders to every unit the player currently has, pushing the limit of simultaneous unit handling from 12 (Warcraft 3 limit) to more than an 100 (units start stuttering after this threshold)

The goal is to improve current feature and try to push the design to revolve more around armies and less around heroes, add more custom abilities and "personal" balance adjustement.
The project also aim at getting rid of GUI trigger/object definition from the original `Footmen vs Grunts` and move toward Wurstscript development, which would ease version control and contribution through git.


# Development
Development is currently on stale, `Footmen vs Grunts` still has an active player, putting out a derived version now could fire up conflict/community split, which may bring toxic behavior between players and toward the developer.

## Features actually implemented:
-Automatic spawn of units
-Army ordering (move, attack, stop, hold)
-Army organization (melee units in front of ranged)
-Bounty on Kill
-Race units object definition
